/**
 * Bisection method is a Iterative method to compute the zero of a given
 *  function `f`. To do so, it needs a left `a` and a right `b` element to start from.
 * It evaluates the mid point and assign it either to the left or to the right margin
 *  so that it has the same sign. It continue doing so till the minimum error `e` is reached.
 *
 * @param a double: left margin;
 * @param b double: right margin;
 * @param e double: approx error needed;
 * @param f double *(double): pointer to the function.
 *
 * @return ans: the zero found by the method.
